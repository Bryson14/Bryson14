### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Budget App 2.0](https://github.com/Bryson14/budget-tracker-2.0)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Tailwinds CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Next.Js Static Serving](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export), and [WebAssembly with Rust](https://rustwasm.github.io/book/)
- âš¡ Fun fact: 
- 1. I've always wanted to make a working trading bot since my undergraduate in uni. I even was in a club to do that, but its a difficult thing
- 2. I graduated in mechanical engineering, but knew that computer science was the better path for me! (I still love mechy things!)
- 3. Learning keeps my life engaging. #lifelonglearner
